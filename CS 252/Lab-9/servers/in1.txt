*  the total income of everyone in the economy and the total expenditure on the economy’s output of goods and services. The
reason that GDP can perform the trick of measuring both total income and totalexpenditure is that these two things are really the same.
For an economy as a whole,income must equal expenditure
* Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time.
Expenditure APPROACH
*  GDP among various types of spending. To do this, GDP (which we denote as Y) is divided into four components: consumption (C),
 investment (I), government purchases (G), and net exports (NX):
        Y  =  C + I + G + NX.
Personal consumption expenditures (C)
• Durable goods :
    Durable goods are products that are expected to last for an extended period,
    typically more than three years, without wearing out or becoming obsolete
• Nondurable goods:
     Non-durable goods are products that are consumed or used up relatively quickly, typically within three years or less.
        Examples of non-durable goods include food, cleaning supplies, and personal care products. 
• Consumer expenditures for service:
        doctor vists,entertainment etc...
Gross private domestic investment (Ig)
• All final purchases of Machinery, 
equipment, and tools by business 
enterprises.
• All construction
Changes in inventories (unsold goods)Money spent on R&D, for the creation of new work of art, music, writing, film …
Gross investment is the total amount of investment in new capital goods, while depreciation is the amount of capital
 that wears out or becomes obsolete over a given period of time.
 **net investment = Gross investment - depreciation;**
"stock of capital" refers to the total amount of physical assets that are used in the production of goods and services.
 These assets include buildings, machinery, equipment, and other durable goods that are used to produce other goods and services. 
 stock of capital increases or decreases based of the value of net investment.
Government purchases (G)
• Expenditures for goods and services
• Expenditures for publicly owned capital
        ex :  military equipment, public infrastructure, and government salaries
• Excludes transfer payments
    These are payments made by the government to individuals or businesses without receiving any goods or services in return. 
    Examples of transfer payments include social security payments, welfare benefits, and unemployment compensation.
Net exports (NX) = Exports - Imports
• Exports
• Spending on domestically produced goods by foreigners
• Imports
• Spending on foreign goods by domestic residents
    GDP Income Approach:
Compensation of employees:
as wages and salaries by business and government to their employees. It also includes wage and salary supplements,in particular,
payments by employers into social insurance and into a variety of private pension, health, and welfare funds for workers
Rents :
Rent consist of the income received by the households and businesses. The figure used in the national accounts is net rent—
gross rental income minus depreciation of the rental property.
that supply property resources. 
Interest :
Interest consists of the money paid by private businesses to the suppliers of loans used to purchase capital.
Proprietor’s income :
Proprietor’s income is the income earned by individuals who own and operate unincorporated businesses, such as soleproprietorships or
 partnerships.
Corporate profits
• Corporate income taxes :
    These taxes are levied on corporations’ profits. They flow to the government
• Dividends
    These are the part of after-tax profits that corporations choose to pay out, or distribute, to their stockholders
• Undistributed corporate profits :
    Any after-tax profits that are not distributed to shareholders are saved, or retained, by corporations to be invested later in new 
    plans and equipment
Taxes on production and imports:
The account called taxes on production and imports includes general sales taxes, excise taxes, business property taxes,
 license fees, and customs duties.

Sum of all the above give u National Income(NI) :
        To get GDP = NI - (foreign factor income) + (Consumption of fixed capital) + (Statistical discrepancy);
            NDP = NI - (foreign factor income)  + (Statistical discrepancy);
            PI = NI - (personal taxes)

Real versus Nominal GDP:
Nominal GDP is the total value of all final goods and services produced in an economy during a given period, 
    typically a year, calculated using the current market prices of those goods and services.
Real GDP, on the other hand, is the total value of all final goods and services produced in an economy during a given period,
    adjusted for changes in the prices of those goods and services over time. Real GDP is calculated by using a base year's prices
    as a reference point to remove the effects of inflation from the current market prices.(ITS NOT AFFECTED BY CHANGE IN PRICES)

    GDP-deflator = (Nominal GDP)/(Real GDP) * 100
This measures the current level of prices compared to the base year.
Inflation:
• Economy’s overall price level is rising
Inflation rate
• Percentage change in some measure of the price level from one period to the next 

Inflation rate
• Percentage change in some measure of the price level from one period to the next

Price index in given year = (price of market basket in specific year /price of same market basket in base year)× 100

Real GDP = (Nominal GDP)/(price index)

The consumer price index (CPI) is a measure of the overall cost of the goods and services bought by a typical consumer
When the CPI rises, the typical family has to spend more dollars to maintain the same standard of living
steps to calculate:
1. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) identifies a market basket of goods and services the typical consumer buys.
2. The BLS conducts monthly consumer surveys to set the weights for the prices of those goods and services
3. Find the prices of each of the goods and services in the basket for each point in time
4. Use the data on prices to calculate the cost of the basket of goods and services at different times
    Price index in given year = (price of market basket in specific year /price of same market basket in base year)× 100
5. The inflation rate is the percentage change in the price index from the preceding period

Reasons for Ineffectiveness of CPI:

Substitution Bias:
• The basket does not change to reflect consumer reaction to changes in relative prices.The index overstates the increase in cost of 
living by not considering consumer substitution
Introduction of new goods:
• The basket does not reflect the change in purchasing power brought on by the introduction of new products
• Consumers need fewer dollars to maintain any given standard of living
Unmeasured Quality Change :
• If the quality of a good rises from one year to the next, the value of a dollar rises, even if the price of the good stays the same.
(vice-versa)
• The BLS tries to adjust the price for constant quality, but such differences are hard to measure

The CPI overstates inflation by about 1 percentage point per year.

Economists and policymakers monitor both the GDP deflator and the consumer price index to gauge how quickly prices are rising.

GDP deflator measures changes in the overall price level of an economy, CPI reflects the price changes of a basket of goods and 
services that are relevant to households

## The consumer price index compares the price of a fixed basket of goods and services to the price of the basket in the base year
## GDP deflator compares the price of currently produced goods and services to the price of the same goods and services in the base 
year

wholesale Price Index(WI):
• It measures the changes in the prices of goods sold and traded in bulk by wholesalei.e., the prices paid by 
businesses when they buy goods from manufacturers or suppliers.
• WPI tracks inflation at the producer level and CPI captures changes in prices levels at the consumer level.
Inflation is indicative of the decrease in the purchasing power of a unit of a country’s currency

PI uses for correcting Economic variables:
• Price indexes are used to correct for the effects of inflation when comparing dollar figures from different times
        Amount in today’s dollars = Amount in year T’s dollars * (Price Index relative to year T)
• Interest represents a payment in the future for a transfer of money in the past.
    •The nominal interest rate is the interest rate usually reported and not corrected for inflation. It is the interest rate that 
    a bank pays.
    • The real interest rate is the interest rate that is corrected for the effects of inflation
     ## Real interest rate = Nominal interest rate –Inflation ##
