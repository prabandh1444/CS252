# Lab08:  Exploring IPv6 Packet format, ICMP protocols and tools

**Objective:**
1.	Dig deeper into the following network layer concepts: IPv6 packet format, ICMP
2.	Watch socket programming videos in preparation for next lab

(Watching the video "Digging deeper into Network Layer" is a pre-requisite for this lab.)

**Reference Material:**
1.	Digging deeper into Network Layer (both parts)
2.	IP packet format
3.	IPv6
4.	ICMP

**Requirements:**
1.	Linux Command Terminal
2.	Wireshark


## Exercise 1: IPv6 Packet Format

IPv6 header differs from IPV4. Let us explore this difference by looking at the respective header formats (see slide 4 of ipv6-slides.pdf on BodhiTree).
You can collect your own trace by pinging an IPv4 and an IPv6 address. We have however provided a single trace (ipv4-ipv6.pcap) in case you have not been able to collect.

*Now attempt the quiz titled "Lab08-IPv6".*

## Exercise 3: Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
**Part A: Traceroute/mtr**

When a flow between two end points is not performing as per expectation, it is useful to debug what is happening along the path. Is it too many routers, is it the delay etc?

**Guidance:**
1.	For this exercise, you should try both traceroute and mtr commands. Traceroute we saw in class. The mtr command is a combination of ping and traceroute commands. More details at https://www.tecmint.com/mtr-a-network-diagnostic-tool-for-linux/
2.	When tracing the path to a host, select a host that is not on the same physical network as your machine. Otherwise, it is too trivial with a hop count of 1. 
3.	To avoid confusion, collect independent wireshark traces, one for traceroute and one for mtr.
4.	It is strongly recommended that you do this experiment yourself and collect your own traces. We have however provided 2 traces corresponding to the traceroute (traceroute.pcap) and mtr (mtr.pcap) in case you have not been able to collect such traces.

*Now attempt the first and second module of quiz titled "Lab08-ICMP".*

**Part B: ICMP Types**

You have read about the different types of ICMP messages. Let us look at them in a packet trace.

**Guidance:**
1.	Design experiments that will produce ICMP messages of the above type in a packet trace.  Refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol#Control_messages
a.	Type 0, code 0
b.	Type 3, code 3
c.	Type 11, code 0

Try to collect the trace yourself. We have however  provided such a trace. Based on the trace, attempt the third module of quiz titled "Lab08-ICMP".*
